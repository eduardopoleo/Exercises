1)What is a class?
It is a code template that basically serves as a mold for creating objects. You can define state attibutes (some can be immidiately initialized) and you can also implement behavior through methods.

2)What is object?
An object is an instance of a class. It possesses a defined state represeted by the data (value of the attributes) stored within it. 

3)What is ruby module? What's the difference between class and module? 
Modules are a collection of methods that can be used across different classes. Works sort of like a library that you can plug wherever you need. The do not define the nature of an object as clasess do. 

One use-case of modules is when we want to extract commom behavior between two classes that won't naturally enhirit from each other.

4)Three levels of method access control for classes and modules?
Public: Methods can be called by anyone. Other classess or instances can call each other public methods. E.x class methods by default 
Protected: These methods can only be called by the intances of the defining class and its subclasess
Private: This methods can not be called with an explicit reciever (the reciever is set to .self). Can only be called by the object containing them.

6) Explain this ruby idiom: a ||= b
In ruby this is the equivalent of 

a || a = b

Which literatlly means if a then do nothing but a is nil, make a equal to b.

In rails this expression allows caching which is useful to increase performance.
def current_user
  @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id])
end

The first time we call this method it will issue a query to the data base but will set and store the result in the cash?, next time we call it there will no need to query the object again.  

8) What is a Proc? Better whats the difference between a block, proc and lamda. Is this relevant when constructing DSLs?
http://awaxman11.github.io/blog/2013/08/05/what-is-the-difference-between-a-block/
Blocks is leterally a block of code that I can use to repeat certain operations over a define set of data, they can be defined as:

[1,2,3].each { |x| puts x*2 }   # block is in between the curly braces

[1,2,3].each do |x|
  puts x*2                    # block is everything between the do and end
end

procs  are instances of the class Proc.  This allows us to call methods on it and assign it to variables (basically store them). Proc basically acts as an anonymous method. 

p = Proc.new { |x| puts x*2 }
[1,2,3].each(&p)
The & converts the proc into a block to be use by the each.
procs can also be call to themselves and the method class can be called on them.

p.call  # prints 'Hello World'
p.class # returns 'Proc'
a = p   # a now equals p, a Proc instance
p       # returns a proc object '#<Proc:0x007f96b1a60eb0@(irb):46>'

Trying to do this with an block with result in errors.
{ puts "Hello World"}       # syntax error  
a = { puts "Hello World"}   # syntax error 

Now a lamda is also an instance of Proc can have the same uses as a proc but with little differences: 
Difference 1) How to initiate them.

p = Proc.new { |x| puts x*2 }
[1,2,3].each(&lam)

lam = lambda { |x| puts x*2 }
[1,2,3].each(&lam)

1)Number of arguments. Lamda checks the number of arguments while procs do not care

lam = lambda { |x| puts x }    # creates a lambda that takes 1 argument
lam.call(2)                    # prints out 2
lam.call                       # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)
lam.call(1,2,3)                # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 1)

proc = Proc.new { |x| puts x } # creates a proc that takes 1 argument
proc.call(2)                   # prints out 2
proc.call                      # returns nil
proc.call(1,2,3)               # prints out 1 and forgets about the extra arguments

There is also another difference regarding the return key.

9) What is unit testing (in classical terms)? What is the primary technique when writing a test?
It is test used over small and isolated portion of code. This chunck of codes usually have very specific and defined functionality (e.g a  simple class or a method)
assert that the result value is equal to the expected

Difference between ==, ===, eql?, equal?.
http://batsov.com/articles/2011/11/28/ruby-tip-number-1-demystifying-the-difference-between-equals-equals-and-eql/
Equal checks for object equality basically verifies that the objects have the same object id.

eql? is a more stricted version of ==
For example 

1 == 1       # true
1.eql? 1     # true
1 == 1.0     # true
1.eql? 1.0   # false
1.0.eql? 1.0 # true

13)Difference between += and .concat
+= creates a new object and .concat mutates the original caller.

Extra) the difference between map, each and collect.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9429034/what-is-the-difference-between-map-each-and-collect

.each
Just do operations over the elements of the enumerable but does not store the result anywhere nor it returns a new enumerable with change values. 
.map is the same as .collect
The create a new array with the new values after they were changed

a = [1,2,3]
=> [1, 2, 3] 
a.each{|n| n+1}
=> [1, 2, 3] 
a.map{|n| n+1}
=> [2, 3, 4] 

14) Why array.map(&:method_name) is equivalent to array.map {|element| element.method_name} 
reference: http://www.brianstorti.com/understanding-ruby-idiom-map-with-symbol/

###
I can wrap my head arond this
I know &basically calls .to_proc on a object.
Now how are map implemented and how can I understand the implementations of symbol to proc

15)Which of the expressions listed below will result in "false"?
true    ? "true" : "false" 
false   ? "true" : "false" this
nil     ? "true" : "false" this
1       ? "true" : "false"
0       ? "true" : "false"
"false" ? "true" : "false"
""      ? "true" : "false"
[]      ? "true" : "false"

16) Write a method that sorts the keys in a hash by the length of the key as a string. For instance, the hash:
h = { abc: 'hello', 'another_key' => 123, 4567 => 'third' }
http://www.sitepoint.com/sorting-algorithms-ruby/

h.keys.map(&:to_s).sort_by(&:size)

19) Consider the following two methods:

def times_two(arg1);
  puts arg1 * 2;
end

def sum(arg1, arg2);
  puts arg1 + arg2;
end

What will be the result of each of the following lines of code:

times_two 5
times_two(5)
times_two (5)
sum 1, 2 => 7
sum(1, 2)=> 7
sum (1, 2) syntax error

When there is only one argument any notation will do.
When there is two arguments the last one will fail.

20) What will val1 and val2 equal after the code below is executed? Explain your answer.

val1 = true and false  # hint: output of this statement in IRB is NOT value of val1!
val2 = true && false

In this case and is and addition operation that ruby allows us to do, so basically set the val1 = true and then yield the value of val1 && false which is false

The second case is just performing an operation true && false

####No idea why this works
21)(a) {p a}["Hello world"]

24) What is a ruby gem?
Is a reusable library that meets a certain format adequate for the use of ruby and rails applications. 
examples of gems that I like: bootstrap_form, carrier_wave, carrierwave-aws, will_paginate etc,


25) What is your favorite api resource for ruby?
None

extra) What does self mean?
Self refers to the current object. The gotcha is that classes are also objects.
So 

Class Whatever
  def test
    puts "This is an instance method #{self}"
  end

  def self.test_class
    puts "This is a class method #{self}"
  end
end

Whatever.new.test
puts "This is an instance method #{self}"

Whatever.test_class
puts "This is a class method #{self}"

extra) What is a Proc?
 and on a simple level we can use it to store chuncks of code inside a variable for instance

26) What's the difference between blocks, procs and lambdas? (Repeat)

27) About sorting in ruby and in ActiveRecord 
sort_by(&:attribute) which is the same as sort_by{|object| object.attribute}
http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/interview-prep/

In ruby is good to use the sort_by method. This method takes in a proc which we can define ourselves. 

No in rails is much better to let sql order the recores retrieved by us

User.all.sort_by{|u| u.first_name} #=> O(log n) Ruby working over the objects extracted on the query
versus
User.order(“first_name DESC”) #=> O(1) Sql working on the records directly 

28) What are some of your favorite gems? What are their alternatives?
I do not know

33) What is the general history of rails?
Started out in 2003 as part of a 37signal project call basecamp. They wanted a better framework for their development. 
DHH saw fit to make it open source as he had largely benefit from the open source community to that point.

37 	Rails	What are the different server options for running a Rails/Rack app?
#######

38) Explain CSRF and how Rails combats it.
Basically there are requests hidden behind html tags such as img for intance. <img src="http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=Alice&amount=1000000&for=Mallory">
The image contains a request to generate an action on another site. If the user is authenticated on this other site and there is no protections against it the actions gets executed without the users permision

To protect against all other forged requests, we introduce a required security token that our site knows but other sites don't know. We include the security token in requests and verify it on the server

40) Define DHH?

Define "tenderlove".

42)Why do some people say "Rails can't scale"?
This controversy came up mainly after twitter decided to move away from rails.
But in reality rails scalabilty will depend on the type of applications that we are building. Twitter was used by millons of people who generated tons of data that needed to be updated very quickly. This is not the case for most web apps.
